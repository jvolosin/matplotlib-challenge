# matplotlib-challenge
Repo for the Rutgers matplotlib HW
This repo contains statistical analysis for data about mice tested with different medicine to control and reduce tumor growth. Different regimens were used to see which medication is more effective. 
To determine which regimen is best, we used scatter plots and box and whisker plots to observe the change in tumor size over time and the average size of a tumor depending on the regimen implemented. 
Statistical analysis was accomplished by using python code and importing pandas and matplotlib dependencies.
